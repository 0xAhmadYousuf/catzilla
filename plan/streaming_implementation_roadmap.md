# Streaming Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for implementing true streaming functionality in Catzilla.

## Phase 1: Temporary Solution (Current)

- ✅ Implement a temporary `StreamingResponse` class that collects all content up-front
- ✅ Support basic content types: text/plain, text/event-stream, text/csv, application/x-ndjson
- ✅ Ensure basic example endpoints work without segfaults
- ✅ Document the current implementation and limitations

## Phase 2: Core C Streaming Implementation (Next)

### C Core Implementation

- [ ] Fix `catzilla_stream_context_t` initialization to ensure all fields are properly set
- [ ] Debug and fix the memory management in `catzilla_stream_create` function
- [ ] Ensure ring buffer implementation is thread-safe and optimized for performance
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup and error handling for streaming contexts
- [ ] Add backpressure detection and handling
- [ ] Implement write callbacks for libuv integration
- [ ] Add stream stats collection for monitoring and debugging

### Integration with Server

- [ ] Fix `catzilla_is_streaming_response` detection to safely identify streaming responses
- [ ] Ensure `catzilla_send_streaming_response` correctly sets up chunked transfer encoding
- [ ] Properly handle HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0 clients
- [ ] Integrate with existing keep-alive logic
- [ ] Handle connection termination and cleanup streaming resources

## Phase 3: Python Streaming API (After C Core)

### Python Module

- [ ] Update Python `StreamingResponse` class to use the C streaming infrastructure
- [ ] Implement proper generator consumption with C callbacks
- [ ] Add `StreamingWriter` class with file-like interface
- [ ] Add context managers for proper resource cleanup
- [ ] Implement event hooks (on_close, on_error, etc.)
- [ ] Add middleware integration for streaming responses

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Add custom buffer sizes and tuning options
- [ ] Implement zero-copy mode for large files
- [ ] Add adaptive buffering based on client speeds
- [ ] Optimize Python/C boundary crossing
- [ ] Implement memory usage limiting

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Advanced Response Types

- [ ] Multipart/form-data streaming for file uploads/downloads
- [ ] Range requests for resumable downloads
- [ ] Compressed streaming (gzip, deflate, brotli)
- [ ] Advanced SSE features (retry, event types)
- [ ] JSON streaming with JSON-Lines format

### Monitoring and Tools

- [ ] Add streaming metrics and statistics collection
- [ ] Create debug tools for streaming connections
- [ ] Implement streaming connection timeouts and limits
- [ ] Add profiling tools for streaming performance
- [ ] Create documentation for tuning and optimization

## Phase 5: WebSocket Support

- [ ] Design WebSocket API aligned with streaming architecture
- [ ] Implement RFC 6455 WebSocket protocol
- [ ] Add room/channel abstraction for broadcast scenarios
- [ ] Create message queuing for offline clients
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization hooks
- [ ] Build examples and documentation

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for all streaming features
- [ ] Benchmark against other frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Express)
- [ ] Test with various client libraries and browsers
- [ ] Verify memory usage and performance characteristics
- [ ] Document best practices and patterns

## Known Issues to Fix

1. Segmentation fault when initializing streaming context
2. Memory leak in content type extraction
3. Improper buffer management between Python and C
4. Missing proper cleanup when connections close unexpectedly
5. Lack of backpressure handling
