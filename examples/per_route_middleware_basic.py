Catzilla Per-Route Middleware Example

This example demonstrates the new zero-allocation, per-route middleware system
in Catzilla. It shows how to:
1. Define custom middleware functions
2. Register middleware for specific routes
3. See middleware execution with different priorities
4. Handle middleware that can skip route execution

The middleware system provides industry-grade performance with C-compiled
execution and zero memory allocation during request processing.
