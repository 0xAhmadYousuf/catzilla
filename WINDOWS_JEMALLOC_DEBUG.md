# Windows Jemalloc Debug Session

## Current Issue
- Build script reports "âœ… jemalloc build completed successfully"
- CMake reports "ðŸ“‹ jemalloc pre-built library not found"
- This indicates a disconnect between what the build script thinks it built and what CMake can find

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be that:
1. The `build_jemalloc.bat` script was exiting early thinking the library already existed
2. The library file might have been empty, corrupted, or in wrong location
3. There was no verification that CMake could actually find the built library

## Debugging Changes Applied

### 1. Forced Rebuild
Temporarily disabled the "library already exists" check to force a fresh build:
```bat
REM Force rebuild for debugging - comment out the existing file check
echo ðŸ”§ Force rebuilding jemalloc for debugging...
echo ðŸ§¹ Cleaning any existing library files...
```

### 2. Enhanced Debug Output
Added comprehensive debugging to see:
- MSBuild detection results
- Library file existence and size
- Build process execution
- Final library creation verification

## Expected Next CI Run Results

With these changes, the Windows CI should now show:
```
ðŸ”§ Force rebuilding jemalloc for debugging...
ðŸ§¹ Cleaning any existing library files...
ðŸ”¨ Building jemalloc static library...
ðŸ”¨ Building jemalloc with Visual Studio...
Building with Visual Studio 2022 solution...
[MSBuild output...]
âœ… jemalloc build complete!
```

And then CMake should find it:
```
ðŸ“¦ Using pre-built jemalloc static library (deps/jemalloc) - Windows
âœ… jemalloc configured with static library
```

## Next Steps
1. **Run CI** - Test with forced rebuild to see actual build process
2. **Analyze Output** - Check if MSBuild actually executes and creates library
3. **Fix Root Cause** - Once we see what's happening, fix the underlying issue
4. **Re-enable Caching** - Restore the "already exists" check once working

## Files Modified
- `scripts/build_jemalloc.bat` - Disabled early exit, added debug output
- Previous fixes still in place:
  - CMakeLists.txt Windows library detection
  - CI MSBuild setup
  - Build configuration fixes

## Rollback Plan
If this doesn't work, we can:
1. Check jemalloc Visual Studio project compatibility
2. Try building with different VS versions
3. Use alternative build methods (vcpkg, manual compilation)
4. Fall back to system malloc with performance warning
