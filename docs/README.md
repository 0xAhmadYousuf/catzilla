## 🚀 Quick Start

### Build the Documentation

```bash
# Check dependencies
make check

# Install dependencies (if needed)
make install-deps

# Build HTML documentation
make html

# Serve locally
make serve
```

### Using the Build Script

```bash
# Check dependencies
python build_docs.py check

# Build documentation
python build_docs.py build

# Serve documentation
python build_docs.py serve
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Live Reload Development

```bash
# Start development server with auto-reload
make watch

# Or specify a custom port
make watch PORT=8080
```

### Quick Build (for development)

```bash
# Build without treating warnings as errors
make quick-build
```

## 📊 Documentation Features

### Based on Real Examples

Every code example in this documentation comes from the working examples in `examples/`:

- **Core Examples**: `examples/core/` → Basic routing, async/sync patterns
- **Validation**: `examples/validation/` → Data models and validation
- **Features**: `examples/*/` → All advanced features
- **Recipes**: `examples/recipes/` → Real-world patterns

### Performance-Focused

- Real benchmark data showing 259% performance improvement over FastAPI
- Performance comparison examples you can run
- Optimization guides based on actual measurements

### Migration-Friendly

- Step-by-step FastAPI migration guide
- Side-by-side code comparisons
- Compatibility notes and tips

## 🏗️ Build System

### Makefile Targets

```bash
make help           # Show all available targets
make html           # Build HTML documentation
make serve          # Build and serve locally
make watch          # Development server with auto-reload
make clean          # Clean build directory
make linkcheck      # Check for broken links
make stats          # Show documentation statistics
make full-build     # Complete build with all checks
```

### Python Build Script

```bash
python build_docs.py build    # Build documentation
python build_docs.py serve    # Serve documentation
python build_docs.py clean    # Clean build directory
python build_docs.py check    # Check dependencies
```

## 📦 Dependencies
