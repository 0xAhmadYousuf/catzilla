This is a sample media file for testing Catzilla's high-performance media serving capabilities.

The media mount is configured for:
- Large cache size (500MB)
- 2-hour cache TTL
- Range request support (perfect for video streaming)
- No compression (media files are already optimized)
- Large file support (up to 500MB)

This configuration is ideal for:
✅ Video streaming
✅ Audio files
✅ Large images
✅ PDF documents
✅ Any binary media content

Range request support means browsers can:
- Seek to any position in videos
- Resume interrupted downloads
- Stream large files efficiently
- Cache partial content

Try testing with:
curl -H "Range: bytes=0-100" http://localhost:8002/media/sample.txt

Performance characteristics:
- First request: File system read + cache storage
- Subsequent requests: Memory cache (ultra-fast)
- Large files: Zero-copy sendfile from kernel
- Range requests: Efficient byte-range serving
