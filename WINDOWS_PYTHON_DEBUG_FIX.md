# Windows Build Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Windows CI builds failing with `LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'python39_d.lib'`
- **Root Cause**: Debug builds require Python debug libraries which are not available in GitHub Actions
- **Solution**: Changed build configuration from Debug to Release mode

## Files Modified

### 1. scripts/build.bat (Windows-specific fix)
```diff
- cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="%PYTHON_EXE%"
+ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="%PYTHON_EXE%"
```

### 2. scripts/build.sh (unchanged - Debug mode works fine on Unix/macOS)
```bash
# Remains as Debug - no issues with Python debug libraries on Unix systems
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3)
```

### 3. WINDOWS_BATCH_FIXES.md
- Added detailed explanation of Windows-specific Python debug library issue
- Documented benefits of Release mode builds on Windows

## Expected Results
✅ **Windows CI builds should now succeed** (Release mode avoids python39_d.lib issue)
✅ **Unix/macOS builds continue working** (Debug mode preserved for development)
✅ **Platform-appropriate optimization** (Windows=Release, Unix=Debug)
✅ **Faster Windows builds** (Release mode is optimized)

## Verification
Push these changes to GitHub to test the Windows CI pipeline. The build should now complete successfully without the `python39_d.lib` linking error.

## Alternative Debugging
If debugging is needed in the future, consider:
- Using RelWithDebInfo build type (optimized with debug symbols)
- Installing Python with debug libraries in development environments
- Using Release builds with appropriate logging/profiling tools
