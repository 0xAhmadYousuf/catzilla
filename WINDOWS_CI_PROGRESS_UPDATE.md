# Windows CI Build Progress Update

## Latest Status: Batch Script Syntax Error Fixed ✅

### Issue Resolved:
- **Error**: `: was unexpected at this time.` in Windows batch script
- **Cause**: Extra closing parentheses in conditional statements
- **Fix**: Cleaned up parentheses structure in `build_jemalloc.bat`

### Major Progress Made:

#### 1. ✅ MSYS2 Autotools Setup Working
The CI logs now show that autotools are properly available:
```
Found bash:
GNU bash, version 5.2.37(2)-release (x86_64-pc-cygwin)
Found autoconf:
autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.72
Found make:
GNU Make 4.4.1
```

This means our MSYS2 setup in the CI workflow is working correctly.

#### 2. ✅ Previous Issues Resolved
- **ANSI color codes**: Fixed all `[0m was unexpected` errors
- **Python debug library**: Changed to Release mode to avoid `python39_d.lib` errors
- **System jemalloc conflicts**: Removed conflicting system installations
- **Batch script variable expansion**: Fixed delayed expansion issues

#### 3. ✅ Build Infrastructure Ready
- MSBuild is available as fallback
- Autotools (bash, autoconf, make) are now available
- Visual Studio environment is properly configured
- jemalloc source code is available via git submodules

### Next Expected Result:
With the syntax error fixed, the Windows CI should now:

1. **Detect autotools successfully** ✅ (already working)
2. **Run jemalloc autotools build** (next test)
   - `autogen.sh` to generate headers
   - `configure` to setup Windows build
   - `make` to compile static library
3. **Install library to expected location** (`deps/jemalloc/lib/jemalloc.lib`)
4. **CMake detect jemalloc** and link successfully
5. **Complete Catzilla Windows build** with jemalloc integration

### Fallback Strategy:
If autotools build still fails, the script will automatically fall back to:
- MSBuild with Visual Studio solution files
- Pre-built library detection and copying

### Files Modified in This Round:
- `scripts/build_jemalloc.bat` - Fixed syntax error (removed extra parentheses)

### Expected CI Outcome:
The Windows build should now proceed past the syntax error and attempt the jemalloc autotools build. If successful, we'll see:
```
✅ jemalloc build complete!
✅ Library accessible to CMake
✅ Catzilla Windows build with jemalloc integration
```

### Monitoring:
Check the GitHub Actions Windows CI logs for:
1. Successful autotools detection (already ✅)
2. Successful `autogen.sh` execution
3. Successful `configure` and `make` build
4. Library creation and CMake detection
5. Full Catzilla build completion

This represents significant progress - we've moved from complete Windows build failure to having all the required tools available and ready for jemalloc compilation.
